# Myportfolio
This project is my personal portfolio website, developed at Bit Academy.

The website shows who I am as a beginner developer and presents my skills and projects.  
Visitors can find information about me, view my work, and easily get in touch with me.

The website is fully responsive and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The design has a personal style and is suitable for internships and job applications.
